This is a game for person who interested in ability to do things simultaneously in which sometimes, it’s important and in need for some people. In this game we have two mode of playing, first – **SINGLE MODE**, second – **ENDLESS MODE**. In game play, we have two screens of games. **Left screen** consists of key **A**, **S**, **W** and **D** that are falling down as the time goes by, you have to press the key that is the same to falling block so that the block will be destroyed and you will get score. Otherwise, if you let the falling block get through the screen, your score will be decreased. **Right screen** consists of circle figures that have number in it range **from 1 to 4**. In order to get score, you have to click those figures ascending in sequence **from 1 to 4**. If you click the figure that is inconsistent with the sequence, your score will be decreased. In **SINGLE MODE**, you have 3 minutes to score as many as you can by which everything works as above. But in **ENDLESS MODE** you will have 30 seconds time remaining and you have to score as many as you can until the time runs out which if you play the game correctly the time remaining will be increased, otherwise if you try to type the key that aren’t falling down or click the figures not in sequence your time will be decreased.
